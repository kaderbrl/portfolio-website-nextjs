						<br />
						I`&apos;`m Kader, a Front End Developer distinguished by my passion for web
						technologies. After graduating top of my class from high school, I took my
						first steps into the field of Information Technology. Later, I graduated
						from Dokuz EylÃ¼l University with a degree in Management Information Systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						I began my career during my high school years, and since then, I&apos;ve
						been experiencing the excitement of web development using technologies like{' '}
						<span className='text-primary font-medium'>HTML, CSS,</span> and
						<span className='text-primary font-medium'>JavaScript</span>. Particularly,
						leveraging modern tools such as{' '}
						<span className='text-primary font-medium'>React JS, Next JS,</span> and{' '}
						<span className='text-primary font-medium'>TypeScript </span> to develop
						user-friendly and cross-browser compatible websites has become a passion of
						mine. For each project, I strive to deliver quality solutions by adhering to
						principles of readable and well-structured coding.
					</p>
					<p>
						To keep up with the rapid changes in technology, I continuously work on
						improving myself and acquiring new skills. However, most importantly, I
						genuinely love what I do. Coding isn&apos;t just a job for me; it&apos;s
						also a passion and a way of life. Each new day increases my excitement about
						becoming a better developer.
